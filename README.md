**Product Data Analyst | Product & Growth Analytics | SQL • Python • Experimentation**

I’m a Product-focused Data Analyst working at the intersection of **data, product, and growth**.  
I use **SQL and Python** to understand **user journeys, activation drop-offs, retention drivers, and monetization levers**, and turn those insights into decisions that shape product roadmaps.

I’ve worked across **AI-enabled platforms, healthcare systems, and enterprise workflows**, partnering closely with product, engineering, and operations teams to improve adoption, efficiency, and data reliability.

## 🧠 Analytics Mindset

> *“Good analytics doesn’t just explain what happened — it shows where to act next.”*

I enjoy ambiguous product problems where data is incomplete, instrumentation needs improvement, and insights must be derived by combining **quantitative signals with product intuition**.
